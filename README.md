# Peaches - Discord Moderation Bot

Peaches is a lightweight Discord moderation bot written in plain Javascript. It was created by me (carrot), a year1 Computer Science student at the University of the West Indies(STA), as a personal project to produce my own discord bot and learn more about bots along with the Discord API.

## Features

Peaches includes the following features:

-Ability to ban, kick, warn, and mute users <br />
-Capability to set auto-role and lock channels  <br />
-Built-in AI command "/peachAI" to answer complex questions <br />
-Option to delete messages and clear channels <br />
-Command to check the server's ping and uptime  <br />
